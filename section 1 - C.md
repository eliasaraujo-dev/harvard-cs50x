## Variables and Types And Printing

### Variables

Create an integer named **calls** that gets the value 4.
<br>
int calls = 4;

Here we have an integer named **x** that gets the value 50.
<br>
int x = 50;

Calls gets 5.
<br>
calls = 5;

### Operators

int calls = 4;
calls = calls - 1;
calls = 3

### Getting input
This case, we try to get an input number, an integer number, we might want to use a function called **get_int**.
<br>
int calls = get_int("Calls: ")
